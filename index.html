        <h1>UNAMESA <br> Nonprofit Website Redesign</h1>
      </div>
      <p>TIMELINE: 3 Weeks • MATERIALS: Sticky Notes, Pen, Paper, inVision, Figma, and Adobe XD.</p>
      <p>UX TECHNIQUES: User Interviews, Competitive Analysis, Affinity Diagram, Site Map, Sketching, Wireframing, and
        Usability Testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>We were hired to redesign the existing UnaMesa website and redevelop the look, feel, and purpose of the site.
      </p>
      <p>UnaMesa is a non-profit organization that strengthens communities by increasing the number and depth of
        meaningful connections. Located in Palo Alto, CA, they incubate projects that create and promote new ways of
        connecting within and across communities. They overarching goal is to work with networks of social enterprises
        to develop shared technologies and frameworks for valuing interactions and relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>We re-designed the current Unamesa website to provide individuals with more meaningful information about the
        organization's mission and vision, and shared ways to get involved and donate to one of the projects.</p>
      <p>We also combined UX writing best practices with an enhanced User Interface to increase the overall website
        usability.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To gain a better understanding of how we could more effectively address this problem, we conducted 5 virtual
        1:1 user interviews with potential users searching for a community based program conneting kids and families.
        The result was almost unanimously negative:</p>

        <div class="chart2">

        <div class="chart3">
          <img src="images/Grafico 3.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Summarizing:</p>

      <!-- My Work Section Constructed using CSS Grid -->
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <p> 100% of the users interviewed agreed UnaMesa's website is poorly designed. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p> 90% agreed this poor design affects the organizations credibility. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p> 90% agreed the Donate button was fairly difficult to find. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Once we got these feedbacks we arranged our findings into an Empathy map, and that helped us understand the
        confusion around the unclear message of Una Mesa’s existing site. As a result of this activity, we were able to
        discover some major trends that we needed to address in the next phase of our design process.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
      <p>In order to visualize the future website experience from the user’s perspective, we created the following
        Journey Map:</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
      <p>We analyzed a few other non-profit sites and concluded some were similar in purpose to Una Mesa, others were
        examples of sites Sharon could feasibly come across as a charitably-minded person.</p>
      <p>We noticed a trend in the lively color palettes and personable branding choices made by most of our
        competitors. Each organization talked about their projects’ impact on beneficiaries’ lives, which made them
        appear trustworthy and credible. Throughout, we noted the use of photographs, particularly of faces, to drive
        each organization’s story.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>Once we organized all our research and defined our design goals, we began to explore potential visual solutions
        for the website. Each team member sketched pages and we came together to decide what to take forward in the
        low-to-mid fidelity stage.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Design | Hi-fi Prototype</h2>
      <h3>Leading users to ways they can support the cause.</h3>
      <p>In order to immediately catch the attention of our users, we designed a donate button as the main call to
        action, further highlighted by the orange color. By making the donate button easily visible, it would make it
        easier and more encouraging for users to contribute — bridging both the organization and user needs.</p>
      <h3>Establishing trust and confidence.</h3>
      <p>We wanted to ensure that the user would feel confident and have trust in UnaMesa so we made sure to incorporate
        this aspect into several different features throughout the website including:</p>
      <p>• Prominently displayed mission statement on the homepage;</p>
      <p>• “Who we are” page to give users a deeper understanding of the organization;</p>
      <p>• “Impact” showcasing facts and statistics about the impact UnaMesa has made in the community;</p>
      <p>• Established list of business partners involved in the UnaMesa's mission;</p>
      <p>• “Testimonials” section featuring personal testimonials from people impacted by or involved with
        UnaMesa</p>
    </div>
