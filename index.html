                <h1>UNAMESA | Nonprofit Organization Website Redesign</h1>
                <p>TIMELINE: 3 Weeks • MATERIALS: Sticky Notes, Pen, Paper, Figma, inVision, AdobeXD.</p>
                <p>UX TECHNIQUES: User Interviews, Competitive Analysis, Affinity Diagram, Site Map, Sketching,
                    Wireframing, and Usability Testing.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>We were hired to redesign the existing UnaMesa website and redevelop the look, feel, and purpose of
                    the site.</p>
                <p>UnaMesa is a non-profit organization that strengthens communities by increasing the number and depth
                    of meaningful connections. Located in Palo Alto, CA, they incubate projects that create and promote
                    new ways of connecting within and across communities.
                    They overarching goal is to work with networks of social enterprises to develop shared technologies
                    and frameworks for valuing interactions and relationships. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>During preliminary usability tests, we discovered that Una Mesa’s website can be confusing for users
                    who are not familiar with the organization.
                    The website lacks clarity for new users due to lack of information,
                    credibility, and information architecture. This way users struggle to connect with the
                    organization’s mission, values, and
                    impact, resulting in decreased engagement.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p> We re-designed the current Unamesa website to provide individuals with more meaningful information
                    about the organization's mission and vision,
                    and shared ways to get involved and donate to one of the projects.</p>
                <p> We also combined UX writing best practices with an enhanced User Interface to increase the overall
                    website usability.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>To gain a better understanding of how we could more effectively address this problem, we conducted 5
                    virtual 1:1 user interviews with potential users searching for a community based program conneting
                    kids and families.
                    The result was almost unanimously negative:</p>

                    <div>
                        <p> 100% of the users interviewed agreed UnaMesa's website is poorly designed </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p> 90% agreed this poor design affects the organizations credibility </p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>They also shared some important insights such as:</p>

                <div class="grid">
                    <div>
                        <p> “This organization is not open to people who don't know about their purpose”</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>“When I see a site like this, it kind of impacts their credibility”</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>“The site is missing any emotional connection”</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Once we got these feedbacks we arranged our findings into an Empathy map, and that helped us
                    understand the confusion around the unclear message of Una Mesa’s existing site.
                    As a result of this activity, we were able to discover some major trends that we needed to address
                    in the next phase of our design process.</p>

                <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
                <p>In order to visualize the future website experience from the user’s perspective, we created a Journey
                    Map.
                    In an ideal setting, Sharon wouldmsearch for a local non-profit to help her community, come across
                    UnaMesa's website, be impressed with what she saw, click around the site to learn what they do,
                    understand the impact they have in her community, and find an easily actionable way to get involved.

                <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p> We analyzed a few other non-profit sites and concluded some were similar in purpose to Una Mesa,
                    others were examples of sites Sharon could feasibly come across as a charitably-minded person.</p>
                <p> We noticed a trend in the lively color palettes and personable branding choices made by most of our
                    competitors.
                    Each organization talked about their projects’ impact on beneficiaries’ lives, which made them
                    appear trustworthy and credible.
                    Throughout, we noted the use of photographs, particularly of faces, to drive each organization’s
                    story.</p>

                <p>Once we organized all our research and defined our design goals, we began to explore potential visual
                    solutions for the website.
                    Each team member sketched pages and we came together to decide what to take forward in the
                    low-to-mid fidelity stage.

                    <h2>Design | Hi-fi Prototype</h2>
                    <h3>Leading users to ways they can support the cause.</h3>
                    <p>In order to immediately catch the attention of our users, we designed a donate button as the
                        main call to action, further highlighted by the orange color. By making the donate button easily
                        visible, it would make it easier and more encouraging for users to contribute — bridging both
                        the organization and user needs.</p>

                    <h3>Establishing trust and confidence.</h3>
                    <p>We wanted to ensure that the user would feel confident and have trust in UnaMesa so we made sure
                        to incorporate this aspect into several different features throughout the website including:
                    <p>• Prominently displayed mission statement on the homepage;</p>
                    <p>• “Who we are” page to give users a deeper understanding of the organization;</p>
                    <p>• “Impact” showcasing facts and statistics about the impact UnaMesa has made in the community;
                    </p>
                    <p>• Established list of business partners involved in the UnaMesa's mission;</p>
                    <p>• “Testimonials” section featuring personal testimonials from people impacted by or involved with
                        UnaMesa</p>
